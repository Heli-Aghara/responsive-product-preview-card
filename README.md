### Live site link:

[product-previw-card](https://product-preview12.netlify.app/)

## Languages used:
1. HTML
2. CSS

## How I did this:
 - I did this challage along with a [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=B2WL6KkqhLQ&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE) of [kevin powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) , who is a great web developer, "madly in love with css" as he says.If you want to do yourself, it's completely ok. but, I would suggest you to go and check the video after you're done with the project. because, He gives a lot of tips in the video.

## For whom this project is for:
-people who know basic html tags and css properties like grid,flex,box-model,etc and practice them in real-life scenario. (of course, this project can be done without flex/grid, but it would be difficult to do it just using margins and paddings imo.) 
<a id="practiced-skills"></a>
## Things that can be Practiced through this project:
- Responsive design
- A use case of `<picture>` tag.
- How to center things using grid/flex, also you will get a chance revise confusing properties like `align-items` and `align-content`.(refer to "css-tricks.com" for better understanding of grid-properties).
-and many more skills.....

## Some tips from my side:
- Try to do mobile-design first as it helps to add complexity later.
- if not necessary, please don't set fixed heights and widths in the beginning, as it makes things harder to make responsive and it might cause overflow issues also.
- if you need to set heights and widths (eg.when centering content inside container using flex or grid), try to set them using percentages(%) or vw/vh units.
- for spacing text-content of product card, instead of using margin/padding ,use flex / grid with "gap" property.
- to limit width of product-card, use "max-width"
property.
- `<picture>` tag can be useful to change product-image at specified breakpoint using `media` attribute, which is simillar to `@media` queries.

## Note:

-  please don't make any changes in my source code. if you want, you can clone this repositary and then make changes.
- If you have any suggestions regarding this project, let me know at "**heliaghara04@gmail.com**".
